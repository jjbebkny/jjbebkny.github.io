	The Armor of Psalms 23

	<div class="God">
	<p>The Lord is my shepherd;
I shall not want.

I cried last night
Do you know what it’s like to be on the outside looking in 
Scratching and clawing at a door that won’t open 
Trying to get through a window that is bolted shut. 
<br>
<br> 

There she was, the girl I kept seeing over and over
I was screaming at her trying to get her attention 
Sunken was she in a dark sea of doubt, confusion, anxiety, resentment, anger, and fear.
She was drowning, slowly losing every piece of herself.
<br>
<br>

I could see the dark deception and black depths of doubts
curated by the enemy, it was clear. 
Melting, taking form and trying to seep into any faulty cracks or crevices within her mind. It was as though she was covered in armor. 
A helmet, the protector of her head and mind, The provider of salvation shielded her from every derogatory untruth.
<br>
<br>

From the elementary school teacher that said she wasn’t good enough.
From her father who she lost trust in.
From herself when she felt as though she was worth nothing and questioning her value.
From the enemy who spit venomous lies onto her God given name.
<br>
<br>  

I couldn’t see her face, or who she was but I was intent on trying to save her. 
I needed to save her for I would not be the same.
<br>
<br>  

***He makes me to lie down in green pastures;
He leads me beside the still waters.
<br><br> 

There was a man right in front of her. His hands stretched out as though they were mirroring my own.
 I was wondering who would get to her first.
Or more so who’s hand would she latch onto to relinquish herself from this unwavering weariness, suffering all alone.
<br> <br> 

She was sinking and then came the overflow of confusion.
 But that man, he emitted a light like no other slicing through each wave guarding her. <br> <br> 

Who was He?
Like a parent to a child, he was reaching to embrace and wrap his arms around her like a belt. 
He aches for her to be free. <br> <br> 

Free with the truth of who she was, the warrior he made in his image & likeness & how flexible he could be for his child as a result of being the all mighty. <br> <br> 

***He restores my soul;
He leads me in the paths of righteousness
For His name’s sake. <br> <br> 

The heart
The core of our body. The organ that pumps blood and nutrients; our source of oxygen. <br> <br> 

I could hear her accelerated heartbeat, with a sound so loud, as if it were mimicking a bass drum. 
Ba Boom, Ba Boom, Ba Boom, Ba Boom <br> <br> 

Anxiety was what began to course through my veins & It was in that moment that my own heart sounded just like hers. 
The same bass drum beating on one accord. <br> <br> 

Her breastplate, worn and torn from the attacks against her heart & her anxiousness that sworn to take that same organ and press it against her chest until she were no longer living. <br> <br> 

Righteous.
For she knew she was filled with righteousness but there were fleeting moments in which she did not believe it to be true. 
Within this consuming sea, losing sense of who she was, the same sense of righteousness went with it. This became one of those fleeting moments. <br> <br> 

Ba Boom, Ba Boom, Ba Boom, Ba Boom
It was then I realized, the girl I was aching to save was myself. I was her and she was me. <br> <br> 

***Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil;
For You are with me;
Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me. <br> <br> 

Resentment and Anger had slowly hardened this heart. 
Towards those who had ever done me wrong. <br> <br> 

It was those same crimes done against me that I punished the Lord for.
If those around me in the physical form had failed me, how could I trust in him in the spiritual. <br> <br> 

But it is my faith that will shelter and cover me like a shield against this raging sea threatening to drown me and swallow me whole. <br> <br> 

Please, help me to know that it is okay to feel as you once felt those same emotions. 
Lord soften my heart and mold it to be like yours. <br> <br> 

***You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
You anoint my head with oil;
My cup runs over. <br> <br> 

Fear, crippled and paralyzed for years. <br> <br> 

Fear. 
It has no room in a place that is filled with the presence of God. 
Those were the words that rang free in my mind. <br> <br> 

As much as I was afraid of the unknown, I trusted that it would be this same man who would grant me peace. <br> <br> 

He would walk with me at a pace of grace, guiding each and every one of my steps, it was in him I would find. 
The truth, my freedom, my salvation. <br> <br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

I was willing to place my hand in his, with the trust that the battle was already fought and won. The key to my satisfaction would be him all along. <br> <br> 

***Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
All the days of my life;
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord
Forever. <br> <br> 

My daughter,
That is who you are. 
Here I stand in place of every doubt, bit of confusion, forms of resentment, trickles of anger, and most of all, the presence of fear. 
You are my child who will sit at the right hand of my thrown. <br> <br> 

Pick up your crown and be filled with my love, mercy, and grace. 
I made you in my image and likeness. 
For anyone who goes against you, shall deal with me at forefront. 
Here you are placed in my armor. 
Prepare for battle with me by your side through it all. <br> <br> 

Buckle around your waist, the belt of truth.
Stand firm in the breastplate of righteousness. 
Fitted on your feet, the gospel of peace.
Firmly grasp the shield of faith which will extinguish the fiery attacks of the enemy. 
Secure the helmet of salvation for it will protect your head and mind.
Take with you, the sword of the Spirit which is my word. <br> <br> 

My word is greater than and will slice into any lie cast onto you by the enemy. My word is the truth. 
The same truth that will grant you freedom.
The same truth that will grant you peace.
The same truth that will grant you salvation. <br> <br> 

Reach out to me and place my hand in yours for you are no longer alone. 
It is your unwavering faith that will guide you through the wavering seas. 
Trust in me and allow me to mold into who you need me to be. A father, a protector, a provider, a shelter, a guide, a healer. For I am omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent.
Forever I am here & you are never alone. <br><br><br>
