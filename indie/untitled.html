		How does she write for truth.
How does He seep in breath that break stutter to inspire earnest response, lagging grit 
to sit in silence
Raw enough to let it all sync in <br><br>

How does art live?
How do scars heal and sound like raw shit?
How does raw, reform to mend skin something new? <br><br>

Is image assured to remain intact by the end of this process 
some may know 
yet the gut to face yourself sick, and cackle, don't reward a reflections glance great pride <br><br>

but, a means 
to remain resistant to a change within me,
humiliation, speaks of worth to latch onto broken for comfort in a lost thing,
we were lost things, something of an old skin. 
When I claim shame, regarding product made perfect 
worth is stripped from the very backs of God's kin. <br><br>

and the abuse,
a massive habit she is to misuse 
every good thing to let it all run dry. <br><br>

how do knowledge get through to vessel who just dont know sometimes?? <br><br>

yet wisdom a grip neva loose less I with-hold from what stabilize judgement. 
Sometimes, tugging onto what wont show me it break so easy,
I fall only to rise again. <br><br>

And palms love to play builder
Though sculpting isnt my craft and
Im not much of an artist
Though Poet for the problem that peaks under pressure to prance in dismay,
rupture in my pleasure to praise
I get busy, when I cease to speak what he's teaching me
Its worthy of my time to tell but I'm all dry <br><br>

Hands workin to mold his perfect 
its like the lessons refigure themselves to tell me,
“novice are the ears toning to mute great excellence”
Not to mistake me id never lessen the blessin of his prescence upon my life
Nor disregard strong rebuke Simply running when there's more to expect within me. 
But Im growing nonetheless. <br><br>

I see a fence
gated for those lean enough to fester upon this meal, 
theres amissla my child in the making, 
theres this thick chapter
and Im feelin none of it, <br><br>

theres this love, there's this longing
and all I want is to give it to you raw, 
sometimes unperfect, most times mere me,
lawless and abounding in memory, <br><br>

theres no emotion in a rusting past 
nevertheless a book shelf sits with various volumes to roam reasons to repeat 
bloopers boomin from old sentiment 
and here she sit 
creating deep pieces to keep a bask the life of flowing waters in the deep sea, 
yet in shallow water she swims to see divers do tricks. 
Wondering the weight of work in these hands and his voice
