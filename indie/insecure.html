	<h1> I'm Insecure </h1>
	<h2>by Joël Edouard </h2>

	<p>
		Aha see I don’t know what to say, how to say, 
when to say it, damn I hate it 
These words 
These Thoughts 
Racing through my mind 100 miles per hour 
speeding, loudly, proudly
Leave me lonely, stares me coldly 
Always be frowning, Feel like I’m drowning
Got my head pounding 
Look like I’m clowning
Crazy I’m sounding
Felling surrounded <br><br>

Just an overwhelming… Noise! 

But out loud, see, that’s different 
See I stumblbleblee... words 
I cut, paste, backspace delete 
My mind like a iPhone with no IOS update 
SOS send help 
I’m insecure  <br><br>

I need you to tell me what to eat 
Where to go, what to wear, how to be 
Are you lying to me 
Is this the right tie 
Does it match my eyes
I don’t… I don’t know…  I don’t know <br><br>

What do I know? 
Aha, what society tells 
What I conform to because 
What I am, who I am doesn’t seem to fit in 
So I force myself to fit in 
Those skinny jeans 
That new supreme, some off white feets 
Maybe smoke some weed 
Drink that Hennessy
Saying things like 
Fall Boy Semester
I’m a Thot 
Get me Lit! Chill, chill <br><br>
 
Am I lying 
No I’m a lion 
I don’t crave to feed a false need 
To cop something with little spiritual value to me 
I’m no self-centered monster 
I’m just a crazy insecure lion 
Sorry I mean hype beast <br><br>

Wait... <br><br>

See I’m no self-centered monster 
I’m just a crazy insecure lion 
Sorry I mean hype beast <br><br>

But excuse me for a moment while I “preach”
See me I’m on a journey 
I’m walking through a valley 
But I fear, a fear manifested through words and 
actions I have no confidence to deliver <br><br>

But I walk 
I walk, because YOU are at my side thy rod and thy staff 
they do comfort me 
But that’s it!
Even when I’m in the valley with God himself 
I’m still finding comfort in things that do not compare: 
A walking stick, really? 
See I’m blinded by a world filled with 
Possessions and unattainable attributes <br><br>

But nah fam forget that! <br><br>

I ain’t of this world that lacks shelter, protection and security... 
such a world can only leave me INSECURE <br><br>

But no 
Each night I recall Psalm 4 <br><br>

I recite it slow so I don’t stumble on the words 
And it says this 
“Let me lie down and sleep 
For YOU alone Lord make me SECURE! “
