	<h1> Art Thou Beautiful </h1>
	<h2>by Jariah</h2>

	<p>
	I sit in an empty field with my 
mind in God’s heavenly hands 
and my heart free with the doves 
Both separate from my flesh. 
Safe. 
Guarded. <br><br>

I reach down and clutch the rich soil 
that is a storyteller to my soul.
I have taken the curved branches of 
willow trees that used to weep for the limbs 
they had to carry and I have prayed for them <br> <br>

I have prayed for the field that I now sit on 
with memories soaked in blood buried 
6 feet under 
Like a potter I have shaped and 
transformed my pain with my pencil and 
she has done it with her paint brush and 
him with his hands as he plays the harp like 
David immersed in God’s goodness <br> <br>

My curves are art. 
The words that dance from my heart are art. 
The magic that my melanin radiates is art. 
The frequencies that I wine on are art. <br> <br>

They run. 
Not because they are afraid of the dark 
but because they are afraid of all this light. <br> <br>

Art thou beautiful?
