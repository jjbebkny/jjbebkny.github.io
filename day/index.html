	<div class="mirror"></div>
	<div class="mirror2"> There was a stranger <br> in my mirror today. <br> The person confused me. <br> Like how could a figure be so <br> familiar <br> yet that much more <br> unreconizable. <br> I don't know him, <br> But I knew him once </div>
	
	<div class="smile"></div>
	<div class="smile2"> I felt the sun touch my skin, <br> it was so warm. <br> I smiled today. <br> Seems like a rare moment. <br> Fleeting pleasnt thoughts. <br> Sometimes it feels like actual <br> contentment.</div>
	
	<div class="scream"></div>
	<div class="scream2"> I screamed today, <br> into my pillow <br> so no one would be alarmed. <br> See I no longer look for <br> or want people's gratification <br> or attention in general. <br> So when I screamed today, <br> and no one was around, <br> I remember the tree. <br> Maybe I can be as strong as the tree <br> No one sees me fall, <br> no one hears a sound. <br> They just see a tall figure, <br> Beautiful, majestic, happy...</div>

	<div class="cried"></div>
	<div class="cried2"> I cried today. <br> You know when you reach that <br> point where you cant hide <br> or deny what you feel <br> What were nightmares are now <br> your daydreams. <br> When you're outside but <br> you feel locked up. <br> When you know you're breathing <br> but air feels faint. <br> I been there <br> I was there <br> I am there... </div>

	<div class="died"></div>
	<div class="died2"> I almost died today <br> I couldn't take it anymore. <br> I wanted it to stop. <br> I wanted everything to stop. <br> I wanted life to just stop. <br> I wanted to freeze time <br> and take a long walk by myself. <br> Don't think, don't speak. <br> Just walk. <br> Just observe. <br> Just listen, <br> to the silence, the nothingness. <br> That's what I wanted, nothingness...</div>

	<div class="pray"></div>
	<div class="pray2"> I prayed today. <br> It's been awhile and it was <br> difficult but I did it. <br> See I've been going around <br> asking for prayers, <br> praying for others, <br> and I neglected my own spiritual needs. <br> I need prayer. <br> I need to talk. <br> Need to let things out. <br> To ask for help, <br> help to persevere through this trial. <br> But He reminded me <br> that His grace is sufficient for me. <br> And by his grace, <br> I am alive and well today.</div>

	<div class="feel"> FEELINGS EXIST VOICE THEM </div>
